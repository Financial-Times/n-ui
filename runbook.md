## Release Details

This app is released using Circle CI.
Rollback is done manually on Github. See [the guide on the wiki](https://customer-products.in.ft.com/wiki/How-does-deploying-our-Heroku-apps-work%3F) for instructions on how to deploy.

When you release an n-ui tag, 3 things happen:

- assets are built and deployed to s3, from where they are linked to/downloaded by apps
- the npm package is published
- during work hours (9am to 4pm), all user-facing apps are rebuilt to pick up the changes

## More Information

There are no monitoring services set up for n-ui. Services which depend on it are individually monitored.

Assets generated by n-ui are stored in a [hashed assets](https://biz-ops.in.ft.com/System/next-hashedasset) bucket which is monitored as Platinum service.
