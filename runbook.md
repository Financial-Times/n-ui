# next n-ui

Server, build and client side bootstrapping for ft.comâ€™s user-facing applications. Most of the user-facing apps on ft.com currently rely on n-ui, it is a critical part of our infrastructure.

_NOTE: n-ui has been now been replaced with [Page Kit] in some ft.com applications._

## First Line Troubleshooting

Problems with n-ui are likely to manifest in the user-facing applications which depend on it. Please follow the troubleshooting guide for the affected application.

## Second Line Troubleshooting

### n-ui Parity issues

- n-ui release failures cause parity issues for any user-facing app which depends on it. The CircleCI build will fail with the message: "Projects using n-ui must maintain parity between versions."
	- Attempt a rebuild of the failed CircleCI workflow.

## Release Details

This app is released using Circle CI.

When you release an n-ui tag, 3 things happen:

- assets are built and deployed to s3, from where they are linked to/downloaded by apps
- the npm package is published
- during work hours (9am to 4pm), all user-facing apps are rebuilt to pick up the changes

## More Information

There are no monitoring services set up for n-ui. Services which depend on it are individually monitored.

Assets generated by n-ui are stored in a [hashed assets](https://biz-ops.in.ft.com/System/next-hashedasset) bucket which is monitored as Platinum service.
