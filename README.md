# n-ui [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Financial-Times/n-ui/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/Financial-Times/n-ui)

Server, build and client side bootstrapping for next's user-facing applications.

**PLEASE DON'T USE THIS OUTSIDE OF USER-FACING FT.COM APPLICATIONS. If you need a good express server with handlebars, metrics etc available consider using [n-internal-tool](https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-internal-tool), [n-express](https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-express) or copying what you need from n-ui**

## Quickstart

n-ui has three parts - a server, a client side 'app shell' (js, css & handlebars layout), and a build. **Expect things to break if you don't use all 3.**

### Server

n-ui is a wrapper around n-express which adds templating and asset loading features

`npm install @financial-times/n-ui`

```
const app = require('@financial-times/n-ui')(opts)

app.locals.nUiConfig = {
	preset: 'complete', // 'discrete' will turn off ads & various popups
	features: {
		lazyLoadImages: true // turns individual features on/off. Check `/browser/bootstrap/js/component-initializer.js` for an up to date feature list
	}
}
```

Where opts is an object supporting all `n-express`'s options, but with many set to `true` by default (see `/server/index.js` for details). Additioanl options include

- `partialsDirectory` String or array - path[s] to load partials from, this in addition to the standard `views/partials` that is set for every app
- `layoutsDir` String - a path to load handlebars views from defults to `node_modules/@financial-times/n-ui/layout`
- `withJsonLd` Boolean - output jsonLD schema information in the page head

### Build
n-ui comes bundled with its own build tool - basically `webpack`, `haikro build` and a little bit of other stuff. To use it, add the following to your Makefile:

```Makefile
build:
	nui build

build-production:
	nui build --production

watch:
	nui watch
```

To define entry points for your assets use a `n-ui-build.config.js` file in the root of your project, which can export any object compatible with n-webpack


### JS

#### App bootstrapping

n-ui takes care of loading polyfills etc, in order. n-ui exports 4 things you'll want to use
- `flags` - the feature/development/maintenance/MVT flags object
- `appInfo` - metadata about the app that's serving the page
- `allStylesLoaded` - a promise that resolves once all the lazy-loaded styles are in place
- `onAppInitialized` [required] - a function to call once the app js has successfully executed. This tells integration tests when the page is 'complete' among other things

`import` one or more of the above from n-ui in your application code, which no longer needs to be wrapped in a function

e.g.

```javascript
import { flags , allStylesLoaded, onAppInitialized } from 'n-ui';

if (flags.get('feature')) {
	component.init();
}

allStylesLoaded
	.then(() => {
		lazyComponent.init();
		onAppInitialized(); // it's up to you to define when your app is 'ready'
	});
```

### Sass
Nothing fancy going on here any more 😄. No mixins (though the n-ui-foundations module has a few you will want to use), no tricky critical path css stuff.

```sass
@import "n-ui/main"
```
This will, when using the n-ui build tool, split n-ui's styles into head-n-ui-core.css and n-ui-core.css files, and the server will inline/linnk to these appropriately.


### Local development

#### Working in n-ui
You should be able to work in n-ui as if it's an app - `make watch` and `make run` should work and serve a demo app on `local.ft.com:5005`

#### Testing in an app
In local n-ui:
- `make install`
- `make build-css-loader`
- `npm link`
- `bower link`

In the app (e.g. next-article):
- `export NEXT_APP_SHELL=local`
- `bower link n-ui`
- `npm link @financial-times/n-ui`
- `make run`

### Releasing n-ui

When you release an n-ui tag 3 things happen

- assets are built and deployed to s3, from where they are linked to/downloaded by apps
- the npm package is published
- during work hours (9am to 4pm), all user-facing apps are rebuilt to pick up the changes

## Server side APIs

### Linked Resources (preload) `res.linkResource(url, meta, options)`
Adds link headers to optimise requests for assets, defaulting to preload behaviour
- `url` - absolute or relative path to the resource
- `meta` - object defining additional properties to add to the header
	- `rel` [default: 'preload'] - value of the `rel` property
	- `as` - value of the `as` property e.g. 'stylesheet'
- `options` - additional options when creating the header
	- `priority` - a value of highest will add the link header _before_ all previously added resources that do not specify this (shodul not normally used by apps - used internally to ensure n-ui's resources are always loaded as wuickly as possible)
	- `hashed` - if true the path to the asset will be resolved to the equivalent hashed aset path

### Navigation
If you pass `withNavigation:true` in the init options, you will have navigation data available in `res.locals.navigation`.  this data comes from polling the [navigation API](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-navigation-api).  This data is used to populate the various menus and navigation items on the apps.  The following data is available

	res.locals.navigation = {
		lists: {
			navbar_desktop: // data for the main nav in the header (only on large screens)
			navbar_mobile: //data for the white strip that appears on the homepage and fastFT pages only on small screens
			drawer: //data for the slide-out menu
			footer: // data for the footer
		}
	}

### Navigation Hierarchy
If you also pass `withNavigationHierarchy: true` in the init options you get some additonal properties detailing the current page's position in the hierarchy.  This is only currently useful on stream pages.  The following properties are added:

	res.locals.navigation.currentItem // the current item
	res.locals.navigation.children //an array of the direct decendents of the current page
	res.locals.navigation.ancestors // an array of the parent items of the current page (top level first)

### Editions
The navigation model also controls the edition switching logic.  The following properties are added

	res.locals.editions.current // the currently selected edition
	res.locals.editions.others //  and array of other possible editions

### Other enhancements
- Our [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) engine loads partials from `bower_components` and has a number of [additional helpers](https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-handlebars). It also points to [n-layout](https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-layout) to provide a vanilla and 'wrapper' layout
- Exposes everything in the app's `./public` folder via `./{{name-of-app}}` (only in non-production environments, please use [next-assets](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-assets) or hashed-assets in production)
